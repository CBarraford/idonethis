# Idonethis

A simple little tool for sending IDoneThis messages.

# Setup

1. Be a team member of Influitive (sorry! I'm going to add some config options so everyone can use this soon).
2. Create a file, `~/.idonethisrc`, with the following contents:

    sender: GmailSender
    username: (your e-mail address)
    password: (your password)

# Usage

Just call the following:

    idonethis "Talked to corporate - like a boss."

It'll be logged in your IDoneThis.
